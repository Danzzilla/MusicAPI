## Project Description
Right now I honestly have no clue what to put here because I dont have a clue what the purpose of this website
will be other than to learn how to work with Spring, APIs, Cloud, and other stuff we might learn in class. Since
we were told to choose something we are passionate about, I decided to choose music. We will see what I can do
on the website related to music lol.
